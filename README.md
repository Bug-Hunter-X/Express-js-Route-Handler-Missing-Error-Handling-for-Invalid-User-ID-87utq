# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid user IDs.  The provided code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters and uses it to find a user in a database (simulated here).  However, it fails to handle the scenario where the ID is not a valid number, which can result in unexpected errors or crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with appropriate error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `node bug.js`.
3. Make a request to `/users/abc` (or a similar invalid ID).
4. Observe the error in the console.

## Solution

The solution involves adding input validation and error handling to the route handler.  The corrected code in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to check if the user ID is a valid number and return a proper error response if it is not.
